<h1>Ecommerce Frontend</h1>

<p>This repository contains the frontend of the ecommerce application. It is built using React with a clean and scalable structure designed for real world applications.

The frontend includes an admin dashboard for managing products, media, and orders, as well as a customer facing website for browsing products and adding items to the cart.

State management is implemented carefully to provide a smooth user experience. Cart data is persisted so it remains available even after page refresh.

The application includes pages for viewing all products, adding new products, managing media, and processing orders. Image uploads are handled through secure backend APIs integrated with Cloudinary.

Environment variables are used on the frontend to manage backend API URLs and configuration, making deployment safe and flexible.

The frontend is deployed on Vercel and is continuously updated. Improvements, new features, and UI enhancements are added regularly as the project grows over time.</p>
